			<ul>
				<li><strong>595 A.D</strong> - Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, a widow and a merchant, employed the Prophet (SAW) to sell her goods. Due to the honesty and diligence displayed by the Prophet in the selling of her goods, she proposed marriage to him, which he accepted, and they gotten married.</li>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>610 A.D</strong> - Jibril revealed the first few verses of the Quran to the prophet while he was thinking about purpose of his existence and God in the Cave of Hira near Makkah.</li>
				<li><strong>613 A.D</strong> - The prophet started with the calling of people to Islam in secret. Khadijah, Ali, Abu Bakr and Zayd were one of the first to accept his calling and become Muslims. After a while he started calling the people of Makkah to Islam publicly, most didn’t respond to the call. Most of Makkans opposed him and started treating him and his followers with scorn and cruelty.</li>
				<li><strong>615 A.D</strong> - To escape the people's cruelty, some of the followers of the Prophet left their homes and went to Ethiopia where a Christian king helped them. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Maltreatment and Boycott</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>616 A.D</strong> - The persecution increased and Makkans decided to boycott the prophet and his clan(Banu Hashim). The prophet and his clan had to live in a valley with no source of food other than leaves and roots of trees. </li>

				<li><strong>620 A.D</strong> - The prophet went to Ta’if to seek help, but the people rejected him and the street urchins pelt him with stones till he was wounded over and blood soaked in his shoes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Night Journey and The Ascent</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>621 A.D</strong> - The Isra and Miraj took place. The prophet was taken on a horse-like creature with wings, brought to him by Jibril, from Makkah to Jerusalem. From the Temple mount in Jerusalem, he was accompanied by Jibril to the Seven Heavens where he met other prophets and came into Allah’s presence.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Hijrah to Madinah</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>622 A.D</strong> - The Makkans came to the decision that to halt the growth of Islam, they had to kill the prophet. So they hatched a plan to kill the Prophet. To save his life, the Prophet left for Madinah with most of his followers where they received a warm welcome from the people of Madinah. This migration marked the beginning of the hijrah calender.</li>
			</ul>

				<li><strong>630 A.D</strong> - The Quraysh violated the treaty which led to the prophet announcing the treaty being revoked. The Prophet and 10, 000 companions marched to Makkah in complete secrecy and the Makkans being completely unaware and unprepared were helpless against the numerical strength and had to surrender in defeat.
